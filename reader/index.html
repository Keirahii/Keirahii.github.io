    <p>You wouldn’t believe how often greenscreen effects show up in movies these days. Heard of it? That’s where, while filming, the actors perform in front of a wall (or an entire set) that’s been painted solid bright green. Only in their heads do they see outer space, or ancient Rome, or the Matrix. Later, software replaces every speck of green in that footage with preselected background video. The result: The actors look as if they’ve been in the Matrix all along.
    <p>A greenscreen is really handy if, say, you’re “The Daily Show” and want your fake correspondent to appear as if he’s in Baghdad or Times Square. But until now, most normal people have never even considered getting a greenscreen apparatus for their homes.These days, film history happens on YouTube, not on television and not—more dramatically still—in the cinema. Cinemas are screening 3-D children’s blockbusters or product-placement flics for sky- diver wristwatches. Film history has all but disappeared from cinema. It has migrated to the realm of Internet downloads.</p>
    <p>And now one might ask why so much of documentary filmmaking, which has been driven from television, has migrated to the world of art. It was, after all, an art magazine which approached us and asked us to hold this discussion.
     
      Why is documentary been taken up by the art world? Both of us make our films with funding for art, with money from film festivals or themed exhibitions. Most likely, it’s that documentary films give art licence to claim real-world relevance.</p>
    <p>Right, yes, I had completely forgotten the whole de- bate about tracking shots! I can elaborate. There are a large number of texts warning of the dangers of cinéma vérité. That something isn’t true just because it has no commentary. That every cut is al- ready a construction. Far more texts about direct cinema than direct cinema films.
      <br>Back to Ozu: Perhaps we can say that if we as filmmakers do not debate whether or not Ozu is an artisan patriarch—and I don’t think he is—then this debate will take place in another forum (the art world, for instance).</p>

      <p> AN <br> IMPORTANT <br> NOTE: WHY <br> GREEN? </p>
     </div>

   
     <div class="after">
      <p> I’ve always wondered why is a green screen green in TV and film making, as opposed to blue or white or beige? – Misha from Brunswick East (The Conversation’s Editor)
      <br> If you’ve ever watched a modern blockbuster film, then you’ve almost certainly seen the magic of green screen compositing – or chroma keying – in action. The technique enables film and TV producers to record actors in front of a plain green backdrop, then replace the backdrop with special effects.
      <br>Why? The really short answer is that green screens are green because people are not green. In order for the effect to work, the background must use a colour that isn’t used elsewhere in the shot – and green is nothing like human skin tone. Of course, people wear green clothes, green jewellery and occasionally have green hair or green makeup, but all those things can be changed in a way that skin colour can’t be.
      <br> Cameras mimic the human eye
      Most still and video cameras work a little like our eyes, with a grid of sensors – or pixels – which detect red, green or blue.
      But rather like we perceive things as having a brightness and a colour, most video electronics and video recorders convert these inputs into separate brightness and colour information, called luminance (or luma) and chrominance (or chroma) in video jargon.
    <br> The luminance is basically the brightness, while the chrominance is the location in the hue/saturation colour circle.
